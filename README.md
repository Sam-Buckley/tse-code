# Understanding SOV Word Order

In linguistics, word order refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence. One common word order is **SOV**, which stands for **Subject-Object-Verb**.

In an SOV language, the typical word order is:
1. Subject
2. Object
3. Verb

Let's break down this structure with some examples:

## Example Sentences:

### English (SVO):
- The cat (subject) eats (verb) the mouse (object).

### TSE Language (SOV):
- Cat (subject) mouse (object) eats (verb).
- Enemies 3 (Subject) are (verb) there (object)
- I (Subject) him (object) will take (verb)
